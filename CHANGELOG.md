# Changelog

## 2025-06-27

Initial implementation based on GitHub OAuth client-provider pattern.

- âœ… Add `withSimplerAuth(handler,config?:{scope?:string})` fetch wrapper to have a one-liner that logs in if unauthenticated and passes user simple user-do access to ctx.
- âœ… Create minimal demo `withSimplerAuth`
- âœ… X OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow implementation
- âœ… Domain-based client identification (no registration required)
- âœ… MCP-compliant OAuth 2.0 server metadata endpoints
- âœ… Encrypted access token storage using Durable Objects
- âœ… Support for both direct login and OAuth provider flows

## 2025-08-15

- âœ… Turn users into a table
- âœ… Add multistub and queryable-object and enable admin login

## 2025-08-16

- ðŸ¤” Figure out if we should require a unique access_token per client-id (since we may wanna reuse it directly for api calls, it makes sense) **yes we do**
- âœ… Improved structure and README of this repo. A lot.
- âœ… Make admin truly read-only
- âœ… Create a new table `logins` that holds the access_token. Store x_access_token on the users, but access_token on the logins.
- âœ… Update datastructure
  - Create a new table `logins` that holds the access_token. Store x_access_token on the users, but access_token on the logins.
  - Ensure the access-token encodes and encrypts `user_id` as well as the `client_id` plus the x access token.
  - access*token format is of format `simple*{encrypted_data}` where the decrypted is in format`user_id:client_id:token`to keep it short. encrypted with `env.X_CLIENT_SECRET`. Now, each client has a different access tokens for each user, and there can be as many as required.
  - For all DO functions that affect either the logins or users table, use `user:${user_id}` for DO name. we can decrypt the access token to know the user_id
  - no backwards compatibility required
- âœ… Every new login would create a new unique login! To not overwrite other devices.
- âœ… Keep track of created at, updated at, and request_count in logins!!! Super valueable stats. The logic should be as follows:
  - upon /callback, set last_active_at.
  - when calling /me, if last_active_at is more than an hour old but less than 4 hours old, only update last_active_at. if last_active_at is more than 4 hours old, increment session_count (there was inactivity for >3 hours)
- âœ… Client needs `withSimplerAuth` implementation that uses arbitrary address for token exchange, not X.
- âœ… Change registered scopes in `simplerauth-client` to just `profile` (standard)

# 2025-08-18

- âœ… Change to use `simplerauth-client` in `universal-oauth-provider`
- âœ… Improve `simplerauth-client` so localhost development 'just works' (But is this secure to open up?) `Invalid client_id: must be a valid domain`. For localhost, getting invalid grant. Test `basedpeople` locally.
  - âœ… Added check to `env.PORT` and header check to see if ip is localhost loopback ip
  - âœ… Fixed client to set temporary cookies for redirect_uri and redirect_to to ensure we can send them to the token endpoint
- ðŸ¤” Specifically for basedpeople, doing a request to `ctx.user` every time makes this worker twice as expensive. Kinda wasteful, but is that important? Maybe, a cache to `/me` can be made configurable? Seems exessive to fetch it every time **Skip for now since this also tracks the user, which is something we want**
- âœ… Create `@wilmakesystems` account with more subtle profile picture, and align the logo with that, so login comes over more trustworthy. **Actually it wasn't needed since it doesn't change anything, but it's good to have a separate account for login so it won't get banned easily. I can now get 'basic' on janwilmake and experiment on that account while keeping this stable**

# 2025-08-19

AMBITION - SOLVE OAUTH ONCE AND FOR ALL! Use this by default unless specificaly disabled (flaredream).

- âœ… If it's easy enough, change to use this login in `markdownfeed`
- âœ… Add configuration `allowedClients` to restrict which clients can authorize.
- âœ… Test markdownfeed MCP with https://mcp.p0web.com. The problem now is that I don't hit 401 because the initialize endpoint is public. How do I tell `withMcp` that authorization is required? Is there a way in MCP authorization to make it optional? How should clients implement optional oauth? **Not possible** there seems no way currently to have an optional oauth requirement. You either make the server public or authenticated!
  - âœ… Make `withMcp` config to respond with 401 with `www-authorize` by proxying the response to a provided endpoint, e.g. `/me`. This one should be compliant, moving the auth compliance one level down.
  - âœ… Confirm new `withMcp` works in markdownfeed
- âœ… Confirm it's secure and complies with https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization.
  - âœ… Added PCKE check and resource check to client, making it work with localhost too
  - âœ… Fix resource audience validation in provider: https://letmeprompt.com/rules-httpsuithu-nwbujx0
  - âœ… Also hold my implementation against https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/security_best_practices
  - âœ… Put a LMPIFY prompt in readme that shows it's all good.

_Create MCP-compatible OAuth Flow Test_

âœ… It'd be great to have a UI myself too for this as part of `universal-mcp-oauth`. Similarly, can be all purely front-end. Let's host it at https://mcp.agent-friendly.com.

If I'm not logged in at https://login.wilmake.com, the flow at https://login.wilmake.com works fine, https://markdownfeed.com works fine as well, but from any MCP client using `universal-mcp-oauth`, it will show `You werenâ€™t able to give access to the App. Go back and try logging in again.`. What is the difference here? The login flow from a client in `simplerauth-client` doesn't work it seems.

(>500 characters)

The problem seems to be that there's a max length of 500 characters to the state param.

âœ… Solved by removing redirect_to from encoded state and putting that in a cookie instead
