# Changelog

## 2025-06-27

Initial implementation based on GitHub OAuth client-provider pattern.

- ✅ Add `withSimplerAuth(handler,config?:{scope?:string})` fetch wrapper to have a one-liner that logs in if unauthenticated and passes user simple user-do access to ctx.
- ✅ Create minimal demo `withSimplerAuth`
- ✅ X OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow implementation
- ✅ Domain-based client identification (no registration required)
- ✅ MCP-compliant OAuth 2.0 server metadata endpoints
- ✅ Encrypted access token storage using Durable Objects
- ✅ Support for both direct login and OAuth provider flows

# August 13, 2025

- ✅ Exchange https://github.com/janwilmake/simplerauth-provider-test with https://github.com/janwilmake/x-oauth-client-provider
- ✅ Test adding servers, see if it works here too
- ✅ Create a separate HTML with a directory of supported MCPs so we can use click-to-login, not having to fill the url per-se
- ✅ Ensure removing the provider again works too
- ✅ Researched and found the proper flow for mcp oauth (which can also be used for regular oauth!)
- ✅ Improve this by adopting https://uithub.com/janwilmake/universal-mcp-oauth/tree/main/mcp-client-server-registration
- ✅ Find a way to make `universal-mcp-oauth` very pluggable so people can make apps with this pattern more easily.
- ✅ Create parallel recipe for tasks that use MCPs ([parallel-tool-calling](examples/parallel-tool-calling/))
- ✅ Test for examples, fix 404: `Token exchange failed: MCP server request failed: 404`. Update README about limitations

## 2025-08-15

- ✅ Turn users into a table
- ✅ Add multistub and queryable-object and enable admin login

## 2025-08-16

- 🤔 Figure out if we should require a unique access_token per client-id (since we may wanna reuse it directly for api calls, it makes sense) **yes we do**
- ✅ Improved structure and README of this repo. A lot.
- ✅ Make admin truly read-only
- ✅ Create a new table `logins` that holds the access_token. Store x_access_token on the users, but access_token on the logins.
- ✅ Update datastructure
  - Create a new table `logins` that holds the access_token. Store x_access_token on the users, but access_token on the logins.
  - Ensure the access-token encodes and encrypts `user_id` as well as the `client_id` plus the x access token.
  - access*token format is of format `simple*{encrypted_data}` where the decrypted is in format`user_id:client_id:token`to keep it short. encrypted with `env.X_CLIENT_SECRET`. Now, each client has a different access tokens for each user, and there can be as many as required.
  - For all DO functions that affect either the logins or users table, use `user:${user_id}` for DO name. we can decrypt the access token to know the user_id
  - no backwards compatibility required
- ✅ Every new login would create a new unique login! To not overwrite other devices.
- ✅ Keep track of created at, updated at, and request_count in logins!!! Super valueable stats. The logic should be as follows:
  - upon /callback, set last_active_at.
  - when calling /me, if last_active_at is more than an hour old but less than 4 hours old, only update last_active_at. if last_active_at is more than 4 hours old, increment session_count (there was inactivity for >3 hours)
- ✅ Client needs `withSimplerAuth` implementation that uses arbitrary address for token exchange, not X.
- ✅ Change registered scopes in `simplerauth-client` to just `profile` (standard)

# 2025-08-18

- ✅ Change to use `simplerauth-client` in `universal-oauth-provider`
- ✅ Improve `simplerauth-client` so localhost development 'just works' (But is this secure to open up?) `Invalid client_id: must be a valid domain`. For localhost, getting invalid grant. Test `basedpeople` locally.
  - ✅ Added check to `env.PORT` and header check to see if ip is localhost loopback ip
  - ✅ Fixed client to set temporary cookies for redirect_uri and redirect_to to ensure we can send them to the token endpoint
- 🤔 Specifically for basedpeople, doing a request to `ctx.user` every time makes this worker twice as expensive. Kinda wasteful, but is that important? Maybe, a cache to `/me` can be made configurable? Seems exessive to fetch it every time **Skip for now since this also tracks the user, which is something we want**
- ✅ Create `@wilmakesystems` account with more subtle profile picture, and align the logo with that, so login comes over more trustworthy. **Actually it wasn't needed since it doesn't change anything, but it's good to have a separate account for login so it won't get banned easily. I can now get 'basic' on janwilmake and experiment on that account while keeping this stable**

# 2025-08-19

AMBITION - SOLVE OAUTH ONCE AND FOR ALL! Use this by default unless specificaly disabled (flaredream).

- ✅ If it's easy enough, change to use this login in `markdownfeed`
- ✅ Add configuration `allowedClients` to restrict which clients can authorize.
- ✅ Test markdownfeed MCP with https://mcp.p0web.com. The problem now is that I don't hit 401 because the initialize endpoint is public. How do I tell `withMcp` that authorization is required? Is there a way in MCP authorization to make it optional? How should clients implement optional oauth? **Not possible** there seems no way currently to have an optional oauth requirement. You either make the server public or authenticated!
  - ✅ Make `withMcp` config to respond with 401 with `www-authorize` by proxying the response to a provided endpoint, e.g. `/me`. This one should be compliant, moving the auth compliance one level down.
  - ✅ Confirm new `withMcp` works in markdownfeed
- ✅ Confirm it's secure and complies with https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization.
  - ✅ Added PCKE check and resource check to client, making it work with localhost too
  - ✅ Fix resource audience validation in provider: https://letmeprompt.com/rules-httpsuithu-nwbujx0
  - ✅ Also hold my implementation against https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/security_best_practices
  - ✅ Put a LMPIFY prompt in readme that shows it's all good.

# August 19, 2025

- ✅ Improved UI of https://mcp.p0web.com, a lot

# August 30, 2025

- ✅ `universal-mcp-oauth`
  - ✅ Update discovery mechanism to draft: https://letmeprompt.com/current-httpsmod-v4jrsv0?key=result
  - ✅ Client needs additional check to `.well-known` if www-authenticate wasn't provided: https://letmeprompt.com/can-you-summarize-wh-8mi4ai0?key=result
  - ✅ For text/event-streams, close the initialization automatically after the required message came back, don't wait for more. Same goes for `tools/list`.
  - ✅ `tools/list` function: https://letmeprompt.com/httpsmodelcontext-ap04440?key=result
  - ✅ Upon authorization, list all tools and store these into the DB as well, and return along with servers from the getProviders function. NB: tools can just be a JSON blob, no table needed
- ✅ `worker.ts & homepage.html`
  - ✅ In HTML, when selecting MCPs, allow deselecting tools as well (all selected by default). the tools are available in the providers.
  - ✅ Put the curl generation in frontend (selection mechanism should update curl)
  - ✅ make curl for anthropic messages API as well (uses mcp_servers prop) (make that secondary curl upon selection)
  - ✅ Allow choosing processor and output text or auto (for simplicity, for now) - see https://docs.parallel.ai/api-reference/task-api-v1/create-task-run.md
  - ✅ ensure to adopt userData.apiKey (remove userData.hasApiKey)

Proposal to have separate domain-hosted document with client information - https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/991

✅ Submitted discussion about DCR security: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/discussions/1405

_Create MCP-compatible OAuth Flow Test_

✅ It'd be great to have a UI myself too for this as part of `universal-mcp-oauth`. Similarly, can be all purely front-end. Let's host it at https://mcp.agent-friendly.com.

If I'm not logged in at https://login.wilmake.com, the flow at https://login.wilmake.com works fine, https://markdownfeed.com works fine as well, but from any MCP client using `universal-mcp-oauth`, it will show `You weren’t able to give access to the App. Go back and try logging in again.`. What is the difference here? The login flow from a client in `simplerauth-client` doesn't work it seems.

FINE https://x.com/i/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=MWlyVUFQWm5fN01qWTlnaVlBbmY6MTpjaQ&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flogin.wilmake.com%2Fcallback&scope=users.read+tweet.read+offline.access&state=eyJyZWRpcmVjdFRvIjoiL2F1dGhvcml6ZT9jbGllbnRfaWQ9bWFya2Rvd25mZWVkLmNvbSZyZWRpcmVjdF91cmk9aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZtYXJrZG93bmZlZWQuY29tJTJGY2FsbGJhY2smcmVzcG9uc2VfdHlwZT1jb2RlJnNjb3BlPXByb2ZpbGUmcmVzb3VyY2U9aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZtYXJrZG93bmZlZWQuY29tJmNvZGVfY2hhbGxlbmdlPWsyUFJ6Vi1BR2NIRVBmYWQ2MmwyRWZmM3phUVZPdkswQmZIN1cyMWppQlUmY29kZV9jaGFsbGVuZ2VfbWV0aG9kPVMyNTYiLCJjb2RlVmVyaWZpZXIiOiI4RWhFNE90YXpWeTJlQW9PTHp1OUg3a1JkWlRqWllBNUI3YUNIREQ1YXdZIiwicmVzb3VyY2UiOiJodHRwczovL21hcmtkb3duZmVlZC5jb20ifQ%3D%3D&code_challenge=wAdD9_ORfPEtsjYc0q3vDEc3O1XC6xnGs8SI7ZCT2so&code_challenge_method=S256

(<500)

(>500 characters)

The problem seems to be that there's a max length of 500 characters to the state param.

✅ Solved by removing redirect_to from encoded state and putting that in a cookie instead

# Fix MCP login (2025-09-08)

✅ Added ability to develop `simplerauth-client` + `x-oauth-provider` on localhost (refactor secure flag and url.origin)

✅ Moved everything into the universal-mcp-oauth repo. removed https://github.com/janwilmake/simplerauth.cloudflare for now!

🤔 Now, simplerauth-client successfully works as client, but also must be a valid provider for an MCP server! This part is still untested and we must be able to test this **fully locally**. The provider will be at http://localhost:3000

✅ Create demo that uses `x-oauth-provider`, `simplerauth-client` and `with-mcp`, then test this with `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector` fully locally.

🟠 Successfully go through Entire OAuth flow with:

1. ✅ mcp inspector
2. ✅ mcp-client-server-registration (make simple UI that also works locally)
3. ✅ deploy it all, then try at Claude.ai

✅ TEST WITH `mcp-client-server-registration` html-client:❗️ Now, I'm getting: `{"error":"invalid_token","error_description":"Token not found or expired"}` for `/authorize` if done from https://mcp.p0web.com. Am I calling the endpoint correctly? Go over the code here. Let's look in the database if things are done correctly and if every error is logged. 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉fixed fixed fixed omg omg omg🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

✅ also works for markdownfeed.com and any other one using login.wilmake.com
