# Tasks with Tools Arena

Parallel Tasks support [MCP Tool Calling](https://docs.parallel.ai/features/mcp-tool-call). This is great, but how can we easily build apps where we can authenticate the MCPs correctly?

The idea with the **Tasks with Tools Arena** is to provide a place where you can login with multiple MCPs, and then execute tasks that use toolcalling.
