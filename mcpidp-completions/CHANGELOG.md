- âœ… Create a simple HTML frontend.
- ðŸ¤” The API can only be used when we have the same X User ID as what the user gets when logging in here for a tool and this is NOT guaranteed, unless we actually teach developers of this API to use the oauth provider first to get the X user ID. IDK if this is the preferred way of doing things. âœ… make it a cloudflare middleware that works with any oauth!
- âœ… Do not support any `require_approval` other than `never`
- âœ… Do not succeed if `stream:true` not provided
- âœ… Better logging when MCP doesn't succeed and has error.
- âœ… Fix why linear/notion don't work
- ðŸ¤” It was very slow because we kept the SSE Stream open. Should be closed after receiving response!
- âœ… Much faster now!
- âœ… Cleaned up lines (1400 --> 800)
- âœ… Explore the best way to provide the tool response event. Ideally it's not in the markdown, but more details are provided in a standardized way.
