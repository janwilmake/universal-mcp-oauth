- ✅ Exchange https://github.com/janwilmake/simplerauth-provider-test with https://github.com/janwilmake/x-oauth-client-provider
- ✅ Test adding servers, see if it works here too
- ✅ Create a separate HTML with a directory of supported MCPs so we can use click-to-login, not having to fill the url per-se
- ✅ Ensure removing the provider again works too
- ✅ Researched and found the proper flow for mcp oauth (which can also be used for regular oauth!)
- ✅ Improve this by adopting https://uithub.com/janwilmake/universal-mcp-oauth/tree/main/mcp-client-server-registration
- ✅ Find a way to make `universal-mcp-oauth` very pluggable so people can make apps with this pattern more easily.
- ✅ Create parallel recipe for tasks that use MCPs ([parallel-tool-calling](examples/parallel-tool-calling/))
- ✅ Test for examples, fix 404: `Token exchange failed: MCP server request failed: 404`. Update README about limitations

# August 19, 2025

- ✅ Improved UI of https://mcp.p0web.com, a lot

# TODO

- ✅ `universal-mcp-oauth`
  - ✅ Update discovery mechanism to draft: https://letmeprompt.com/current-httpsmod-v4jrsv0?key=result
  - ✅ Client needs additional check to `.well-known` if www-authenticate wasn't provided: https://letmeprompt.com/can-you-summarize-wh-8mi4ai0?key=result
  - ✅ For text/event-streams, close the initialization automatically after the required message came back, don't wait for more. Same goes for `tools/list`.
  - ✅ `tools/list` function: https://letmeprompt.com/httpsmodelcontext-ap04440?key=result
  - ✅ Upon authorization, list all tools and store these into the DB as well, and return along with servers from the getProviders function. NB: tools can just be a JSON blob, no table needed
- ✅ `worker.ts & homepage.html`
  - ✅ In HTML, when selecting MCPs, allow deselecting tools as well (all selected by default). the tools are available in the providers.
  - ✅ Put the curl generation in frontend (selection mechanism should update curl)
  - ✅ make curl for anthropic messages API as well (uses mcp_servers prop) (make that secondary curl upon selection)
  - ✅ Allow choosing processor and output text or auto (for simplicity, for now) - see https://docs.parallel.ai/api-reference/task-api-v1/create-task-run.md
  - ✅ ensure to adopt userData.apiKey (remove userData.hasApiKey)
  - Fix selection of tools to actually make a different cURL.

After it works, start testing tasks with MCPs and start talking about it!

- Fix errors - `{"type":"error","error":{"ref_id":"51f78b52-913c-4198-ad65-eeb176ad6972","message":"Run failed.","detail":null}}`
- Add refresh token rotation. figure out the best way to do this
  - maybe adding a proxy (/mcp/proxy/{url}) that performs refresh if token is expired will be best?
  - maybe just expose a function `refreshTokenIfNeeded(provider)` or even `stub.getFreshProviders(mcpUrls:string[]):Promise<MCPProvider[]>`
- Understand problems with current implementation (https://letmeprompt.com/httpsmodelcontext-o5keiu0)
- Create Integration-friendly Task API with MCP IDP built-in (by passing stable `user: string` ID) that instantly responds with a markdown-URL and JSON-URL on which the result will be able to be found without auth (`store:true` indefinitely, `store:false` for 24 hours)
