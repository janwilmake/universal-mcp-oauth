- âœ… Exchange https://github.com/janwilmake/simplerauth-provider-test with https://github.com/janwilmake/x-oauth-client-provider
- âœ… Test adding servers, see if it works here too
- âœ… Create a separate HTML with a directory of supported MCPs so we can use click-to-login, not having to fill the url per-se
- âœ… Ensure removing the provider again works too
- âœ… Researched and found the proper flow for mcp oauth (which can also be used for regular oauth!)
- âœ… Improve this by adopting https://uithub.com/janwilmake/universal-mcp-oauth/tree/main/mcp-client-server-registration
- âœ… Find a way to make `universal-mcp-oauth` very pluggable so people can make apps with this pattern more easily.
- âœ… Create parallel recipe for tasks that use MCPs ([parallel-tool-calling](examples/parallel-tool-calling/))
- âœ… Test for examples, fix 404: `Token exchange failed: MCP server request failed: 404`. Update README about limitations

- âœ… Improved UI a lot

# TODO

- `universal-mcp-oauth`
  - Update discovery mechanism to draft: https://letmeprompt.com/current-httpsmod-v4jrsv0?key=result
  - (ðŸŸ CONTEXT) Client needs additional check to `.well-known` if www-authenticate wasn't provided: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/985
  - For text/event-streams, close the initialization automatically after the required message came back, don't wait for more. Same goes for `tools/list`.
  - `tools/list` function: https://letmeprompt.com/httpsmodelcontext-ap04440?key=result
  - Upon authorization, list all tools and store these into the DB as well, and return along with servers from the getProviders function

`worker.ts & homepage.html`

- In HTML, when selecting MCPs, allow deselecting tools as well (all selected by default)
- Put the curl generation in frontend (selection mechanism should update curl)
- Test against anthropic messages API as well (make that secondary curl upon selection)
- Allow choosing processor and output text or auto (for simplicity, for now)

After it works, start testing tasks with MCPs and start talking about it!

- Fix errors - `{"type":"error","error":{"ref_id":"51f78b52-913c-4198-ad65-eeb176ad6972","message":"Run failed.","detail":null}}`
- Add refresh token rotation. figure out the best way to do this
  - maybe adding a proxy (/mcp/proxy/{url}) that performs refresh if token is expired will be best?
  - maybe just expose a function `refreshTokenIfNeeded(provider)` or even `stub.getFreshProviders(mcpUrls:string[]):Promise<MCPProvider[]>`
- Understand problems with current implementation (https://letmeprompt.com/httpsmodelcontext-o5keiu0)
- Create Integration-friendly Task API with MCP IDP built-in
