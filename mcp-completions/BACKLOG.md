# Flaredream MCP

I can now already turn https://flaredream.com/system.md into an MCP, albeit with manual auth. Post about it?

First MCPs I want:

- **Iterate Agent** `deploy` tool at the end: `deploy.flaredream.com/download.flaredream.com/id` for Flaredreams initial generation, using `deploy` tool after it's done (deploy tool must have access to intermediate result)
- **Feedback agent** for Testing a flaredream deployment (`test(evaloncloudID,request,criteria)=>feedback` tool that processes request into feedback, and `final_feedback(feedback, replace_feedback:boolean, status: "ok"|"fail"|"retry")` will end the agent)

This is a great first milestone having the 2 MCPs separately. With this I can verify manually if this works. After that, a looping agent can use both in a loop!

# Deployment MCP

- âœ… Improve cloudflare provider, create `login-with-cloudflare` package.
- Use that in https://deploy.flaredream.com and make it an MCP using `withMcp`
- Use deploy.flaredream.com/mcp as MCP tool with flaredream LMPIFY FormData stream, from within flaredreams landingpage. This requires login with Cloudflare as well as my personal API key for LMPIFY (for now)

I should now be able to start the entire request from flaredream.com, and let users look into the response if they want to (but not require that). I can now just add XMoney to flaredream and use XYText as interface.

Idea - allow context of the generation to include MCP urls! This way the tools used become part of the definition. Logical! Imagine having a tweet MCP, all it'd take would be something like this:

```md
https://xymake.com/mcp

Hey, this is a tweet. It can literally just be understood one on one
```

# Frontmatter support?

```
---
model: lmpify/flaredream
tools: https://deploy.flaredream.com/mcp
---
```

Frontmatter, if present, would always be removed from the prompt. It could also allow for tools this way (running it would first redirect to login if mcp isn't authenticated yet)
